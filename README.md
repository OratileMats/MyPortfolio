🔗 Oratile Matsapola’s Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my skills, projects, and professional information in a clean, responsive web format — built with core web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

💡 Overview

This portfolio website is designed to represent who I am as a developer and to highlight key aspects of my work:

It's fully responsive, works across screen sizes using media queries, and includes interactive JavaScript behavior for enhanced user experience.
